    "**TLDR**: This post will serve as a gentle introduction to attentional interfaces in deep neural architectures using Tensorflow. Incorporation of attention mechanisms is very simple and can offer transparency/interpretability to our complex models. We will also be using preprocessed data, but for optimal inference performance, it is suggested that you retrain the model from scratch using all 25,000 training/test samples. But the main focus of this post will be on attention mechanisms and how you can add them to your networks for increased interpretability.\n"

    "Attentional interfaces in deep neural networks are loosely based on visual attention mechanisms in many animals [1]. These mechanisms allow the organisms to dynamically focus on pertinent parts of a visual input and respond accordingly. This basic idea of selective attention has been carried over to deep learning where it is being used in image analysis [2], translation [3], question/answering [4], speech [5], and a variety of other tasks.\n",

    "<center>Attention on an image for a specific (underlined) word in the caption. [2]</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "These interfaces also offer much needed model interpretability by allowing us to see which parts of the input is attended to at any point in time. A common disadvantage with deep neural architectures is the lack of interpretability and the associated \"black box\" stigma. Implementation of these interfaces has not only shown to produce better results but more transparent and sensible results as well. And as you will see in our implementation below, they produce some pretty cool visualizations that are consistent with how we, as humans, would attend to the input.\n",

    "Research on attentional interfaces is very popular these days, as they offer multiple benefits. There are increasingly complex variants to the attention mechanisms but the overall foundation remains the same. In this post, we will take a look at the fundamental attentional interface, implement it into a small model and then discuss some recent variants. We will be using attentional in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks but will briefly explore other mediums as well. "

    "First, let's take a closer look at the fundamental idea behind an attentional interface. The attention model takes in j inputs, along with some information s_i-1 and outputs vector c which is the summary of h_i focusing on the information s_i-1. Before we see what goes on internally, it is important to point that there are couple different options for attention (soft, hard) but the type we will focus on will all be completely differentiable (ex. soft). This is because we want to be able to learn where to focus. This also means that we will also be focusing everywhere at all times but we will learn where to place more attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of our s_i-1 as the generated context describing what we should focus on. We take the dot product of each input item with this context in order to product a score. The scores (e) are fed into a softmax to create our attention distribution. We multiply these normalized scores with our original inputs to receive a weighted summary vector for timestep/input i."

    "One of the main advantages of using an attentional interface like this is the opportunity to interpret and visualize the attention scores. We can see for each input, where the model places more attention and how that impacts our final result. There are many ways to implement fully differential attentional interfaces but the internal intricacies can differ. The example we have above is very commonly seen in neural translation models.With translation, we don’t want just one summarizing vector using all of the inputs but we want a summarizing vectors for each input. This is because translation is not a one-to-one output. Words in one language may result in multiple words in another, so we need to attend to the entire sentence for all inputs while using that context information so we know what we have seen so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can go ahead and plot the attention scores for translation and we will see something like below. Notice how some words, like \"my\", very clearly only need to attend to one word. But other words, or groups of words, require attention across multiple words from the source language in order to translate properly."

The dataset includes text reviews with ratings from 0-9 but we will use ratings 0-4 as positive and 5-9 as negative sentiment. More specifics, including unlabeled data for unsupervised learning and data collection details are provided in the dataset's README.md\n",

In this diagram, you will notice how the attention layer is almost just like a pluggable interface.

    "We will start by talking about operation functions. _xavier_weight_init() is a little function I have in order to properly initialize our weights depending on the nonlinearity that will be applied to them. The initialization is such that we will receive outputs with unit variance prior to sending to the activation function. This is an optimization technique so we do not have large values when applying the nonlinearity, as that will lead to saturation at the extremes, leading to gradient issues. We also have a helper function for layer normalization, ln(), which is another optimization technique that will normalize our inputs into the GRU before applying the activation function. This will allow us to control gradient issues and even allow us to use larger learning rates. The layer normalization is applied in the customGRU() function prior to the sigmoid and tanh operations. The last helper function is add_dropout_and_layers() which will add dropout to our recurrent outputs and will allow us to create multi-layered recurrent architectures. "

    "You can see how the model starts with equal attentional distribution to all words and then starts to learn which words are important in order to predict the sentiment. The first sanity check is that the <PAD> tokens receive almost no attention. And then we start to see focus on really strong/influential words. Check out few of the other reviews as well and you will see that almost always, there is quite a bit of attention at the ends of reviews which is where people give a conclusion statement that summarizes their sentiment succinctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the sentiment analysis task in order to see how simple it is to add an attentional interface. Though we were able to receive some meaningful attention scores for this task, it is not a trivial task to interpret even with attention. Most reviews (discarding the extremes) will usually talk about the plot for most of the review so it is pretty cool that we can use attention to pick up on the brief moments of sentiment. An interesting extension of this implementation would be to only use the extreme reviews, where there is a spew of emotion throughout the review. "

    "This is one of the basic forms of attention and we can already start to see some interpretability. This is currently a very active area of research where there are developments in different types of tasks using attention (VQA, translation, etc.), different types of attention and better attentional interface architecture. In this post so far, we have seen how attentional processing can be unique to the task. With the translation task, the attentional interface is applied to each input word and a summarized context is made for each time step. This is because translation is not always a one-to-one task and a word may depend on several words in the target language for the correct translation. However, for our sentiment analysis implementation, it wouldn't make sense to have a summarizing vector for each input because our output is a binary sentiment. Similarly, there are also processing variants for tasks such as question and answering (ex. pointer attention to specific words in the input) and image based attention (ex. focusing on different parts of the represented image).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also have variants to the architecture of the interface as well. This too is a large, open field of research and we may cover some of the interesting one in future posts. But I would like to introduce one of the architecture variants that is relevant to our sentiment analysis (or any NLU) task. In the attentional interface we implemented, you may notice that we completely disregard the order of the input review. We processes all of the words in the review but when we read a review and try to determine the sentiment, it is important to have context for what we have already read. A small tweak in the attentional interface can help us overcome this issue."

    "In order to incorporate order of the input into our attentional interface, all we have to do is first, compute the attention scores for each token in the input. Then we feed in one token at a time, with the scalar (or vector) attention score in place of the update gate in the GRU. We do this for all tokens in the input and we take the final (relevant output) or all of the outputs, which of course depends on our task and model architectures. This tweak allows us to incorporate the order of the input along attentional scores. Giving us both interpretability and a logical architecture."
