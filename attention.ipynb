    "**TLDR**: This post will serve as a gentle introduction to attentional and memory-based interfaces in deep neural architectures using TensorFlow. Incorporation of attention mechanisms is very simple and can improve transparency interpretability in our complex models. We will conclude with extensions and caveats of the interfaces. The intended audience for this notebook are developers and researchers who have some basic understanding of Tensorflow and fundamental deep learning concepts. Check out this [post](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/hello-tensorflow) for a nice introduction to Tensorflow."

    "Attentional interfaces in deep neural networks are loosely based on visual attention mechanisms, found in many animals. These mechanisms allow the organisms to dynamically focus on pertinent parts of a visual input, and respond accordingly. This basic idea of selective attention has been carried over to deep learning, where it is being used in image analysis, translation, question/answering, speech, and a variety of other tasks.\n",

    "These interfaces also offer much needed model interpretability, by allowing us to see which parts of the input is attended to at any point in time. A common disadvantage with deep neural architectures is the lack of interpretability and the associated \"black box\" stigma. Implementation of these interfaces has not only been shown to increase model performance, but also offer more transparent and sensible results. And as you will see in our implementation below, they produce some interesting visualizations that are consistent with how we would attend to the inputs.\n",

There are increasingly complex variants to the attention mechanisms, but the overall foundation remains the same. In this article, we will take a look at the fundamental attentional interface, implement it with a small model, and then discuss some recent variants. We will be using attention in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks but will briefly explore other areas as well."

    "First, let's take a closer look at the fundamental idea behind an attentional interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "The attention model takes in j inputs ($h_1, h_2, … h_j$), along with some information $s_{i-1}$ (memory), and outputs vector c, which is the summary of the hidden states focusing on the information $s_{i-1}$. Before we see what goes on internally, it is important to point out that there are a couple of different options for attention (i.e. soft, hard), but the type we will focus on will all be completely differentiable (ex. soft). This is because we want to be able to learn where to focus. This also means that we will be focusing everywhere at all times, but we will learn where to place more attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of our $s_{i-1}$ as the generated context describing what we should focus on. We take the dot product of each input item within this context in order to produce a score. The scores (e from equations on figure 3) are fed into a softmax to create our attention distribution. We multiply these normalized scores with our original inputs to receive a weighted summary vector for timestep/input i."

    "One of the main advantages of using an attentional interface is the opportunity to interpret and visualize the attention scores. We can see for each input, where the model places more attention, and how that impacts our final result. There are many ways to implement fully differential attentional interfaces, and the internal intricacies can differ. The example we have above is very commonly seen in neural translation models. \n",
    "\n",
    "With translation, we don’t want just one summarizing vector using all of the inputs -- we want a summarizing vector for each input. This is because translation is not always a one-to-one output. Words in one language may result in multiple words in another, so we need to attend to the entire sentence for all inputs, while using that context information so we know what we have seen so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can go ahead and plot the attention scores for translation, and we will see something like Figure 4. Notice how some words, like \"me\", very clearly only need to attend to one word. But other words, or groups of words, require attention across multiple words from the source language in order to translate properly.\n"

We also have a helper function for layer normalization, `ln()`, which is another optimization technique that will normalize our inputs into the GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) before applying the activation function. This will allow us to control gradient issues and even allow us to use larger learning rates. The layer normalization is applied in the `custom_GRU()` function prior to the sigmoid and tanh operations. The last helper function is `add_dropout_and_layers()` which will add dropout to our recurrent outputs and will allow us to create multi-layered recurrent architectures."

    "Let's briefly describe the model pipelines and see how our inputs undergo representation changes. First we will initialize our placeholders which will hold the reviews, lens, sentiment, embeddings etc. Then we will build the encoder which will take our input review and first embed using the GloVe embeddings. We will then feed the embedded tokens into a GRU in order to encode the input. We will use the output from each timestep in the GRU as our inputs to the attentional layer. Notice that we could have completely removed the attentional interface, and just used the last relevant hidden state from the encoder GRU in order to receive our predicted sentiment, but -- adding this attention layer allows us to see how the model processes the input review.\n",

These scores are then broadcasted and multiplied with the original inputs to receive our summarized vector. We use this vector to receive our predicted sentiment via normalization in the decoder.

The darker the color, the stronger that particular word is attended to. The first sanity check is that the PAD tokens receive almost no attention; then, we start to see focus on really strong/influential words. Check out a few of the other reviews as well, and you will see that almost always, there is quite a bit of attention at the ends of reviews, which is where people give a concluding statement that summarizes their sentiment succinctly.\n",

Most reviews (discarding the extremes) will usually talk about the plot for most of the review so it is interesting that we can use attention to pick up on the brief moments of sentiment. An interesting extension of this implementation would be to only use the extreme reviews, where there is a spew of emotion throughout the review."

    "Our implementation of the soft attentional interface is one of the basic forms of attention, and we can already start to see some interpretability. This is currently a very active area of research where there are developments in different types of tasks using attention (VQA, translation, etc.), different types of attention, and better attentional interface architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, in this article, we have seen how attentional processing can be specialized to the task. With the translation task, the attentional interface is applied to each input word and a summarized context is made for each time step. This is because translation is not always a one-to-one task and a word may depend on several words in the target language for the correct translation. However, for our sentiment analysis implementation, it wouldn't make sense to have a summarizing vector for each input because our output is a binary sentiment. Similarly, there are also processing variants for tasks such as question and answering (ex. pointer-based attention to specific spans in the input) and image-based attention (ex. focusing on different parts of the represented image).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also have variants to the architecture of the interface as well. This too is a large, open field of research and we may cover some of the interesting variants in future articles. Here, we’ll introduce one of the architecture variants that is relevant to our sentiment analysis, or any natural language understanding task. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the attentional interface we implemented, you may notice that we completely disregard the order of the input review. We processes all of the words in the review, but when we read a review and try to determine the sentiment, it is important to have context for what we have already read. A small tweak in the attentional interface can help us overcome this issue."

Then, we feed in one token at a time, with the scalar (or vector) attention score in place of the update gate in the GRU. We do this for all tokens in the input and we take the final (relevant output) or all of the outputs -- which of course depends on our task and model architecture. This tweak allows us to incorporate the order of the input, along attentional scores -- giving us both interpretability and a logical architecture."

This can be a major factor when using these models for production systems, so it is really important to understand the types of tasks these interfaces prove to be really valuable in. For the tasks we talked about here, adding these interfaces really allows us to overcome the information and interpretability bottlenecks. For the specific task of binary sentiment analysis, we can get similar performance with just a bag-of-words model but the model ultimately depends on the performance you are looking for and the computational constraints."
